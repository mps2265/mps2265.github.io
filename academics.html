                    <p>I have taken two classes in design optimization, AERO 405 and MEEN 683. 
                    In both of these courses, a survey of optimization algorithms were presented 
                    and applied to a semester long project. During these courses I learned about 
                    gradient and heuristic optimization methods and applied them in various 
                    homework and project based applications.  </p>

                	<p>In AERO 405, we were paired into teams of 4 students who worked on 
                	scripting a structural model in Abaqus (Dassault Systems FEA software)
                	to be optimized. Our project was to design the interior structure of a 
                	aircraft wing for a light sport aircraft. This project was subject to 
                	material constraints and worked to minimize weight and tip deflection. A
                	multiobjective approach was taken to avoid infeasible solutions, and were 
                	treated as a weighted average. The weighting of this objective function was
                	based on student intuition and a design of experiments that informed parameter 
                	and design variable influence.</p>
                	<p>In AERO 683 the objective of the class was to use multidisciplinary tools 
                	to solve a design problem. The project that I chose to pursue was a morphing airfoil
